Letâ€™s say one of your micro services is running on http://localhost:3000  
If you already have a nginx service running on the server, create a server block like this:
```bash
vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/domain.com.conf
```
Grab this content to paste in:
```
server {

        server_name domain.com;

        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html;

        location / {
                proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }

}
```
Make a link of the config file:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/domain.com.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```
Check the validity of your config file with this command
```bash
sudo nginx -t
```
Now that it went fine, you will be able to see your public domain will be showing your landing page or something like that.  
Itâ€™s time to secure your service with Letâ€™s Encrypt (Let's just assume that the server is running Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic for simplicity):  
```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install software-properties-common
add-apt-repository universe
add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
apt-get update
apt-get install certbot python-certbot-nginx
certbot --nginx
```
Now, you will have to configure a cron job for auto-renewing the received certificates.  
```bash
certbot renew --dry-run
crontab -e
```
Grab this code **followed by an empty line**  
```
0 0,12 * * * python -c 'import random; import time; time.sleep(random.random() * 3600)' && certbot renew

```
It seems you did an awesome job! ðŸ˜‰  
**A Bonus Tip:** Nginx Purging - Right Way
```bash
apt purge nginx nginx-common nginx-full
```
On CentOS 7/8, you need to configure SELinux as well like so:
```bash
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect on
```
Happy coding! ðŸ˜Ž
