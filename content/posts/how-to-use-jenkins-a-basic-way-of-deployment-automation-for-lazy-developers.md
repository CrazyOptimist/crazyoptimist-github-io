I strongly believe that "lazy developers" can be called "talented developers" in a motivational viewpoint.  
Okay, let's get started with Jenkins setup then.  
{{< gist crazyoptimist e8836cee62dc52a05a94cbcbb6783a09 >}}

Let's go for  password login for deployment, remembering that it's not the only way nor an elegant way of implementation, but just follow up ;)  

### CHANGE SSH PORT - FOR DESTINATION SERVER
```bash
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
Find out the line `#port 22` and uncomment it to change into `port ${YOUR_NEW_SSH_PORT}`, then reload the sshd service like so:  
```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```
One more additional step for firewall (ufw in Ubuntu, firewall-cmd in CentOS), but we will refer to tons of materials out there, instead of mentioning it here.  

### ENABLE PASSWORD LOGIN FOR DESTINATION SERVER
In the same file as just above (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`), do some modification like so:  
```
PasswordAuthentication yes
PermitRootLogin prohibit-password -> PermitRootLogin yes
```
```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### CREATE A PUBLIC KEY - FOR DESTINATION SERVER
```bash
ssh-keygen  # yes to all
cat /home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
Now you are seeing a public key of the destination server, which is called `Deploy Key` in **Project Settings** section on your github repo.  
I think you got some sense on how to use it now.  

### CREATE A JENKINS JOB
You need **SSH plugin** besides the preinstalled recommended plugins in your Jenkins plugin shed.  
Pretty straightforward hereafter, once you know shell script, you will get things done smoothly.  
Feel free to ask any help in case you got stuck. hey@crazyoptimist.net ðŸ˜Ž
